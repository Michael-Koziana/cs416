  <br/><h3>Fundamental Questions:</h3><br/>
  <p style="padding-left : 2%"> Is the death rate per 100,000 a good indictator of economic growth or decline?</p>
  <p style ="padding-left:2%"> Is the vaccination rate of the country a good metric of growth or decline?</p>
  <br/><h3>Project Objective and Background:</h3><br/>
  <p style="padding-left : 2%"> As we all know, Covid wreaked havoc on the world in the year 2020 and till this very day, and it left numerous consequences with it, including many socioeconomic problems.</p>
    <p style="padding-left : 2%">This project explores the idea that
     there might be casual links between covid cases and/or vaccinations to overall economic growth trends and forecasts for the years 2021 and 2022.</p>
    <p style ="padding-left:2%">Does the spread of covid inhibit economies? Is the vaccine a reliable indictator of the forecast economic growth of 2020 and 2021? The goal of this project is to explore these questions and visualize some components! While this is a loaded question, there might be some correlation between various datapoints!</p> </p>
